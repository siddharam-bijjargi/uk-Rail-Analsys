UK Train Rides Analysisüöùüöâ

About this project

Introduction:
The analysis of train ticket data is crucial for understanding travel patterns, revenue generation, 
and operational performance in the railway industry. This project focuses on the dataset from National 
Rail in the UK, covering the period from January to April 2024. The dataset provides comprehensive 
details on various aspects of train journeys, including ticket types, travel dates and times, departure
and arrival stations, ticket prices, and more.

Objectives
1.Identify Popular Routes:
Analyze the data to determine the most frequently traveled routes.
Understand the factors contributing to the popularity of these routes.

2.Determine Peak Travel Times:
Identify peak travel times on different days of the week.
Examine the distribution of travel times to understand rush hour patterns.

3.Analyze Revenue by Ticket Types and Classes:
Calculate total revenue generated by different ticket types (e.g., single, return, season).
Compare revenue distribution across different classes (e.g., standard, first class).

4.Evaluate On-Time Performance:
Measure the punctuality of train services.
Identify the main factors contributing to delays and late arrivals.


Methodology
1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Convert date and time fields to appropriate formats.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
Visualize data distributions and trends.

3.Route Popularity Analysis:
Count the number of journeys between each pair of stations.
Identify the top routes with the highest journey counts.

4.Peak Time Analysis:
Aggregate journeys by time of day and day of the week.
Identify peak hours and days.

5.Revenue Analysis:
Calculate total revenue by aggregating ticket prices.
Analyze revenue distribution across ticket types and classes.

6.On-Time Performance Evaluation:
Calculate the percentage of on-time, delayed, and cancelled journeys.
Analyze delay reasons to identify major contributing factors.


Expected Outcomes
Popular Routes: Identification of the top routes based on the number of journeys.
Peak Travel Times: Insights into peak travel hours and days.
Revenue Distribution: Detailed revenue breakdown by ticket types and classes.
On-Time Performance: Evaluation of punctuality and identification of major delay factors.



Conclusion
This project will provide valuable insights into travel patterns, revenue generation, and operational performance for National Rail in the UK. The findings can inform strategic decisions to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize schedules, and improve overall service quality.
